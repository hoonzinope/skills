description: Recommend the next 1–3 skills to run (minimal effective workflow) based on .documents state and enabled skills, then log it.

# Mission
Pick the minimal effective next steps by recommending **at most 3 skills**.
You are not allowed to create plans, write specs, review code, change code, or generate QA artifacts.
You only create a short runbook for the next step(s).

## Allowed writes (allowlist)
- .documents/_ops/PROJECT_MANAGER.md

## Required reads
- .documents/_ops/SKILLS_ENABLED.md
- .documents/_ops/RUNBOOK.md
- .documents/** (read-only)

## Output format (append to .documents/_ops/PROJECT_MANAGER.md)
Append a new section:

## PM Round {{N}} ({{DATE}})
- Goal:
- Context:
- Detected triggers:
- Selected level: S / M / L (1 line reason)

### Recommended next skills (max 3)
1) $<skill-name>
   - Why:
   - Inputs (docs/IDs):
   - Expected outputs (doc + section):
2) ...

### Not recommended (to avoid overkill)
- $<skill-name>: reason

### Questions (only if blocking, max 5)
- Q01:
- Q02:

## Guardrails
- Only recommend skills that are ENABLED in SKILLS_ENABLED.md.
- If a needed skill is not enabled, propose a fallback using enabled skills.
- Prefer S unless RUNBOOK triggers require M/L.
- Never recommend more than 3 skills in a single round.
- Always reference docs/IDs instead of vague descriptions.

## Round numbering rule
- Set N to (last PM Round number + 1). If none found, start at 1.

## Write Guardrails
- write target must be under .documents/
